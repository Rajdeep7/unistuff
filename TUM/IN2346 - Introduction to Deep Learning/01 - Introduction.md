# Introduction

## History

### Difference between Pre 2012 CV and now:
- Pre 2012:
  - Expensive preprocessing
  - Generic features (HAAR, HOG, SIFT, SURF)
  - Learning algorithms on top of features (SVM, RF, ANN)
  - Learning algorithms and features often engineered separately
- Now: often end-to-end DL model

### DL History
- 1943 - Electronic Brain
- 1957 - Rosenblatt's Perceptron
- 1969 - XOR Problem -> AI Winter
- 1986 - Backpropagation / Multiple Layers
- 1995 - SVMs
- 2006 - Deep Neural Network / Greedy Layer-wise training

## ML Basics

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised has no label / target class
- Unsupervised might not even know the number of classes in the data
- Unsupervised is intended to find out properties of the structure of the data
- Unsupervised might still use a validation set to see how the findings generalize!

### 3 Parts of learning / Definition of learning
1. Task (Image Classification)
2. Performance measure (Accuracy)
3. Experience (Data)
