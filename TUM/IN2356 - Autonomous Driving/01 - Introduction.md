# Introduction

## Current Research Topics

### RACE 
Since the technology in cars improved over many decades, the electronics are chaotic. RACE aims to provide a simple and structured system.

### Adversarial Examples
Not only small pixel perturbations but also objects in the physical world can make a model trained on ImageNet predict obviously wrong categories. (In the video, they printed a texture onto a turtle).

### Semantic Scenario Inerpretation and Decision Making
Goal was to restrict the learning algorithm by giving it a hard-coded ontology of high-level driving rules

### Digital Testfield
Roads and highways, where german car manufacturers can try out their autonomous vehicles

### Multisensor Data Fusion
Radars and Neural Networks are not always correct - the goal is to reconcile their outputs to produce better estimates (ensemble learning).

## Notes
- The topics listed on the course website are currently inaccurate 
- High resolution maps will be a main topic in the exam
- Exam preparation lecture will contain hints about what will be in the exam
- The exam won't be easy
- The "desired outcome" part on slide 6, lecture 1 will be a guideline for the exam
- Convoy track (convoy truck) might be a good topic for the exam
- Throughout the lectures, the lecturer will go through old exam questions, explain why these questions were asked etc. -> more hints about the exam!
