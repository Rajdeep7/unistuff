# IN2349 - Advanced Deep Learning for Robotics

Course page: https://bbaeuml.github.io/ss18-advanced-dl-for-robotics/

`Summary.md` contains the content of all lectures in Q&A format. Most of the content consists of formulas (for example derivation of Monte Carlo Dropout). These are not in the .md file, so it might not be too helpful for studying for the exam.
