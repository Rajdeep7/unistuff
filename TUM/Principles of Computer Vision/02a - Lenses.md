# Lenses

### What is refraction?
Brechung - rays change their direction

### Where is the focal point of a concave mirror?
The point where all incoming paraxial rays intersect

### How are rays deflected on glass surfaces?
On the slow side (glass), they are closer to the normal line than on the fast side (air)

### What is a thin lens? Why do the approximate deflection rules only apply to them?
- Distance to focal point is much larger than thickness of lens.
- For thick lenses, the rays bend up / down, even when passing through the lenses center

### How is the focal length defined?
Distance between focal point F and lens, positive <=> converging lens

### What are the three rules of converging lenses?
1. Incoming parallel rays are deflected through the focal point
2. Rays passing through the center are undeflected
3. Rays passing through the focal point become parallel to the axis

### Real vs. virtual image?
Virtual -> no light rays reach the same location

### What happens to an image that is closer to a converging lens than its focal length?
- The rays coming from the same object diverge and will never intersect.
- It looks like they are coming from a much larger object further away -> Magnifying glass

### What are the three rules of diverting lenses?
1. Incoming parallel rays are deflected so that they appear to be coming from the focal point on the other side
2. Rays passing through the center are undeflected
3. Rays that without refraction would pass through the focal point become parallel to the axis

### What is the object and image distance?
- Object is positive for left side objects
- Image is positive for right side images

### What is the object and image size?
Positive for objects and images above the axis

### What is the lens equation?
1 / object + 1 / image = focal length

### How can you calculate object size, image size and magnification?
M = image size / object size = - image distance / object distance

### How is the Power of a Lens defined? How can you calculate it for combined lenses?
1 / f[m] = P[diopters]
- positive for converging lenses
- negative for diverging lenses
- combined lenses -> add them together

### How can you compute the parameters for multiple lenses?
Take the image of the first as an effective object for the seconds etc. (object distance will be negative!!)

### What is a Fresnel lens?
Takes only the glass parts at the curved surface
