# Introduction

### What is CV?
Computing Properties of the 3D world from one or more digital images

### Difference between Image Processing and Computer Vision
Image Processing -> Concerned with image-to-image transformations
- Filtering
- Enhancement
- Compression

Computer Vision -> Concerned with how images reflect the 3D world
- Filtering for feature extraction
- Enhancement for recognition
- Compression that preserves geometric information in images

### 4 Applications of Computer Vision
1. Biometrics
2. Medical Imaging
3. Data Acquisition (3D models of objects)
4. Motion Control
