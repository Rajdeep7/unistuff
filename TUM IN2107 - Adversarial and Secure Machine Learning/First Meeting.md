# Notes from the first meeting

[Slides](https://www.sec.in.tum.de/i20/assets/vorlesung/adversarial-and-secure-learning-introduction.pdf)

## Introduction to the research area
Attack goals: causative attacks means poisoning the data so that the model learns ill-intended behavior

## Grading
- Participation in the seminar will cause a better grade
- You are only allowed to miss one meeting and that one only with a good cause
- Report and presentation contribute equally to the final grade

## Report structure
- Abstract needs to be even shorter than the paper's abstract
- The two reports are separate! -> abstract - introduction - ... - conclusion - abstract 2 - introduction 2 - ... - conclusion 2
- Correct bibliography and citations are very important. It may severely impact the grade if done wrong
- A comparison of the papers is optional
- Assume that the reader knows that you do a summary 
  - don't mention anywhere that you are doing a summary
  - no introduction with "i am summarizing this and that"
  - just start with the first abstract, first content, second abstract, second content, optional conclusion / comparison
  - i.e. no bridging texts between separate parts
- Document should have 1 title and 2 chapters but completely separated contents
- You don't need to repeatedly cite the two main papers, but the need to be in the bibliography
- Personal idea: write a lorem ipsum report and ask instructor if general structure is okay

## Presentation structure
- Use one slide for "Introduction to the topic"
- Backup arguments means to explain 
  - why the authors used this and that method
  - why xyz is an important evaluation
  - etc.
  - should be in the regular presentation / doesn't mean backup slides!
- Should not miss a key result, but doesn't need to be complete like include proofs etc. -> comprehensibility first!
- We can assume that students have basic machine learning knowledge -> SVMs, neural networks, training / test set etc. is given
- Maybe add some slides about related work into the presentation
- Have some slides of comparison of both papers at the end
- Personal idea: use Material Design template for slides
